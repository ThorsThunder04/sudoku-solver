# C++ Sudoku Solver

Program that uses backtracking to solve a sudoku problem of a given size

The input is currently kinda long and really annoying if you make a mistake (gotta restart heh). But I will probably do something to input from a text file later on, which is less tedious.

Current use:
- Enter the sub-grid size: on a 9x9, it would be 3 for example, and on a 4x4 it would be 2
- Enter each line of your grid, with the numbers separated by spaces and 0s for the missing numbers
- Enjoy the result
